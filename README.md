# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze all the rideshare data and create visualizations in order to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Then, we also analyzed and created a multi-line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
During our first analysis, we calculated a couple of things. First was the average fare for each city and the number of rides for each city. After we calculated all of this, we made a scatter plot to show the differences between the three cities: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. From the chart below, we can see that Urban cities had the most amount of drivers, and Rural cities had the least. Urban citites also had a significantly higher amount of rides compared to Rural cities, and the Suburban cities sat right in the middle. When it came to the average fares though, Rural cities had a much higher cost than Suburban and Urban cities. This makes sense because in order to make up for the lack of rides, Rural cities have to increase their fares in order to make any kind of money.

We then calculated and plotted three different things:
 - Percentage of total fares by city type
   - Urban: 62.7%
   - Suburban: 30.5%
   - Rural: 6.8%
 - Percentage of total rides by city type
   - Urban: 68.4%
   - Suburban: 26.3%
   - Rural: 5.3%
 - Percentage of total drivers by city type
   - Urban: 80.9%
   - Suburban: 16.5%
   - Rural: 2.6%

Finally, we analyzed the total fares by city type for each week. In the line chart below, you can see how each city either goes down or up in fares based on the week the rides were given. For instance, we can see that all city types, Urban, Suburban, and Rural, have a peak in ride fares in the last couple weeks of Februrary. Rural cities hit a peak during the first week of April, as does Urban cities by a little bit, but Suburban cities do not. This chart is very useful as we can see when the most profitable weeks will be as well as the weeks where cities might lose some money.

## Summary
We have gathered quite a bit of data from all of these analyses, and now we can conclude a few things. First, we see that Rural cities have a low ride count and a high fare price. If rides in Rural cities were made more accessible and affordable, then perhaps the number of rides would go up. People aren't going to want to get a ride in Rural areas if it's going to cost them a lot of money. Then, by making ride sharing more accessible, it would make sense that the number of drivers would also go up in these areas as the demand would go up. It would benefit everyone in the area. We can see from Urban cities that has the number of drivers and rides go up, the average fare drops significantly. Even so, the majority of PyBer's revenue occurs in Urban cities. If PyBer wishes to make more revenue in Rural or Suburban cities, they need to start looking at dropping the ride fare amount so more people would be interested in using their ride share app.
