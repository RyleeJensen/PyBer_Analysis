# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze all the rideshare data and create visualizations in order to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Then, we also analyzed and created a multi-line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
During our first analysis, we calculated a couple of things. First was the average fare for each city and the number of rides for each city. After we calculated all of this, we made a scatter plot to show the differences between the three cities: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. From the chart below, we can see that Urban cities had the most amount of drivers, and Rural cities had the least. Urban citites also had a significantly higher amount of rides compared to Rural cities, and the Suburban cities sat right in the middle. When it came to the average fares though, Rural cities had a much higher cost than Suburban and Urban cities. This makes sense because in order to make up for the lack of rides, Rural cities have to increase their fares in order to make any kind of money.
